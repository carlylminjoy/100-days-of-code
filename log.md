# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the FCC curriculum. Completed HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & jQuery sections, along with project 1: Build a Tribute Page. 

**Thoughts:** The project was quite challenging and I was constantly looking up the Bootstrap documentation, but it felt good to work out for myself.

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the 2nd FCC front-end project: Build a Portfolio Site.

**Thoughts:** Took probably around 6 hours to complete. I'm still finding things confusing, like the best way to construct a navigation with Bootstrap, when to use Bootstrap classes or custom classes, when to use padding or margins, when to use containers and whether to embed, etc. Trying to let go of the perfectionist attitude with my new motto "better done than good". Last time I tried to go through this curriculum I failed because I tried to make things perfect.. Won't be making that mistake again!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Basic Javascript section on FCC. Finished a basic HTML/CSS site for a uni assignment. 

**Thoughts:** Things started to click really easily when learning JavaScript because it's somewhat similar to Java. When things start to click, I feel more motivated and inspired to keep going. HTML & CSS are starting to click too the more I do it. Hopefully I can keep this up.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished OOP JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Things are starting to feel a little more challenging with JavaScript. The language is a little difficult to get my head around considering I'm so used to Ruby.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic Algorithmic Scripting challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** The first few felt like a piece of cake until I started having to think more creatively when JavaScript didn't have the Ruby functions I'm used to. About the third or fourth challenge in, I felt myself slowing down and having to research documentation pretty thoroughly, which is great because it means I'm learning new things!
