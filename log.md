# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the FCC curriculum. Completed HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & jQuery sections, along with project 1: Build a Tribute Page. 

**Thoughts:** The project was quite challenging and I was constantly looking up the Bootstrap documentation, but it felt good to work out for myself.

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the 2nd FCC front-end project: Build a Portfolio Site.

**Thoughts:** Took probably around 6 hours to complete. I'm still finding things confusing, like the best way to construct a navigation with Bootstrap, when to use Bootstrap classes or custom classes, when to use padding or margins, when to use containers and whether to embed, etc. Trying to let go of the perfectionist attitude with my new motto "better done than good". Last time I tried to go through this curriculum I failed because I tried to make things perfect.. Won't be making that mistake again!

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Basic Javascript section on FCC. Finished a basic HTML/CSS site for a uni assignment. 

**Thoughts:** Things started to click really easily when learning JavaScript because it's somewhat similar to Java. When things start to click, I feel more motivated and inspired to keep going. HTML & CSS are starting to click too the more I do it. Hopefully I can keep this up.

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished OOP JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Things are starting to feel a little more challenging with JavaScript. The language is a little difficult to get my head around considering I'm so used to Ruby.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic Algorithmic Scripting challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** The first few felt like a piece of cake until I started having to think more creatively when JavaScript didn't have the Ruby functions I'm used to. About the third or fourth challenge in, I felt myself slowing down and having to research documentation pretty thoroughly, which is great because it means I'm learning new things!

### Day 6: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic Algorithmic Scripting challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Some pretty challenging concepts here - RegExp is still pretty over my head, no matter what language I'm working on. Feels like I'm creating lambda functions in some of these algorithms without even I'm realising that I'm doing it.. I honestly just don't know. Proud that I got through this section but really would like to understand what just happened and understand the language a little better! Time to start working through Udemy courses?

### Day 7: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished JSON APIs section on FCC

**Thoughts:** Cool - doesn't look as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I never even knew what JSON or APIs meant until today. The more I learn, the less overwhelming things seem to be. 

### Day 8: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started intermediate js algorithms

**Thoughts:** Completed one fairly easily, but got super stuck on the second one. Not totally familiar with js method calls yet but I think the logic is something I can figure out with a little more time. Just had to do some quick work today during a break at work.

### Day 9: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Random Quote Generator Project on FCC

**Thoughts:** Thought I'd try to learn some flexbox for the basic layout of this one. Was pretty easy to refresh, though I'm still a bit dodgy on a lot of the properties. Trying to figure out how the hell to create an API request for JSON was impossible, spent hours with very little results. Where is the documentation to help for absolute beginners?

### Day 10: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** Took freaking ages and a lot of brain power and research to figure out the JSON API request via jQuery. First of all, realised I'm a total idiot and none of my tests were working because I forgot to add jQuery to CodePen. Idiot! From there, I could start testing code and through trial and error and looking at a bunch of jQuery code, I think I created a pretty clean and concise way of achieving what I wanted.

### Day 11: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** Added functionality to tweet quotes. Had some trouble with url string interpolation. Pretty happy with the result.

### Day 12: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started weather app

**Thoughts:** Wrote some js for retrieving coordinates. Had some trouble with CodePen constantly refreshing.. Had to migrate project to local development.

### Day 13: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Still trying to figure out how to best retrieve data from the API. Still not totally confident with js and trying to get my head around correct methods and syntax. A lot of trial and error to achieve not much, but at least I'm beginning to get the hang of the language. Successfully retrieved the json at least - just need to find a way to design the js code cleanly.

### Day 14: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Worked on style and layout mainly today. Experimenting with Bootstrap alignment properties and responsivity.

### Day 15: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Added temperature functionality and toggle button for fahrenheit and celsius. Spent a lot of time on these functions and making code as clean as possible. Also added functionality to change background image to represent current weather conditions. Super happy with the design of my js code; I think it's really clean and easy to follow. I'm proud of this project.

### Day 16: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished weather app

**Thoughts:** Changed url to secure server & it seemed to fix the github viewer issues so my site can be viewed by others now.
