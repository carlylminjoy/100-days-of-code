# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the FCC curriculum. Completed HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & jQuery sections, along with project 1: Build a Tribute Page. 

**Thoughts:** The project was quite challenging and I was constantly looking up the Bootstrap documentation, but it felt good to work out for myself.

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the 2nd FCC front-end project: Build a Portfolio Site.

**Thoughts:** Took probably around 6 hours to complete. I'm still finding things confusing, like the best way to construct a navigation with Bootstrap, when to use Bootstrap classes or custom classes, when to use padding or margins, when to use containers and whether to embed, etc. Trying to let go of the perfectionist attitude with my new motto "better done than good". Last time I tried to go through this curriculum I failed because I tried to make things perfect.. Won't be making that mistake again!
