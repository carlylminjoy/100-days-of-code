# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 65: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Learning about CSS transitions and implementing them in my portfolio to display animated skill level bars. It's amazing how much excitement a few simple transitions adds.

### Day 64: October 17, 2017 (4h19m)

**Today's Progress**: A buttload of algorithms

**Thoughts:** 4 and a half hours of solving problems with ruby and javascript. Things are starting to click, I'm needing to research less, and I'm solving problems I had no chance with 2 months ago. Lots of lightbulb moments. 

### Day 63: October 16, 2017 (4h25m)

**Today's Progress**: Todo app: styling

**Thoughts:** Started styling the todo app from the practical javascript course. This has required a refactoring of javascript code, because I want to add filter buttons and the ability to click a todo to complete it. I had so much fun doing this and it really reinforced everything I learned about javascript from the practical javascript course. Being able to extend functionality and add features to existing code feels like a pretty goddamn important skill.

### Day 62: October 15, 2017 (4h22m)

**Today's Progress**: Continued Watch and Code Premium subscription: TodoMVC jQuery Part 1

**Thoughts:** Got through the rest of this section. This certainly is practical and useful information, and learning techniques for reading source code really isn't something I had thought much about before. It makes a lot of sense, particularly using the console and debugger to walk through specific functions and try to break things to understand how they work. 

### Day 61: October 14, 2017 (37m)

**Today's Progress**: Started Watch and Code Premium subscription: TodoMVC jQuery Part 1

**Thoughts:** Okay this is a lot heavier than the practical javascript course. Learned how to read to source code, a thorough and effective process. Super useful information and I'm glad I spent the time to go through this, even though it was quite long and sort of unexciting.

### Day 60: October 13, 2017 (2h17m)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Practical Javascript course: V10, 11

**Thoughts:** Learned a tonne about 'this', bind and apply methods and source code is starting to look a lot less foreign. 

### Day 59: October 12, 2017 (2h47m)

**Today's Progress**: Practical Javascript course: V10, 11

**Thoughts:** The javascript forEach loop - I finally get it. 

### Day 58: October 11, 2017 (26m)

**Today's Progress**: Practical Javascript course: V7, 8, 9

**Thoughts:** I'm learning new and better ways to organise code for javascript projects and object oriented design is making a lot more sense. I realised that in my past projects, I really could refactor them and make the code a lot cleaner.

### Day 57: October 10, 2017 (2hr33m)

**Today's Progress**: Practical Javascript course: V3, 4, 5 & 6

**Thoughts:** I am addicted to this course. I just kept moving through all the versions, because each version had a whole bunch of new information that was so interesting and well taught that I just wanted to keep learning more. More javascript knowledge feels like its increasing exponentially. Yay!

### Day 56: October 9, 2017 (2hr56m)

**Today's Progress**: Javascript and ruby algorithms on CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I spent hours working through a bunch of easy-medium algorithms to refresh my skills and solve the same solutions in two different languages. I realised I really do love ruby, it is such a beautiful and logical language to me. However, I am so glad that I have finally started to learn javascript and am getting the hang of it, because it is something that scared me for such a long time. I do feel that my javascript skills are catching up to my ruby skills, which is awesome, because its probably what I will be using when I get a job :)

### Day 55: October 8, 2017 (1hr30m)

**Today's Progress**: Practical Javascript course

**Thoughts:** I love this course. Small bite sized units make it super easy to digest. Plus I am learning a tonne about javascript and everything is starting to click after all the project work from the previous round. I am disappointed I had a small break and have to start from day 1, but at the same time I think the break has just motivated me to work harder this time around.


### 2 WEEK BREAK :(


### Day 54: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: PHP & AJAX

**Thoughts:** Took a closer look at how PHP interacts with AJAX. Still feels a bit confusing, as I am not particularly familiar with either of these technologies. Don't really want to be sidetracking with this - just simply have to for this uni exam.

### Day 53: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: PHP, Javascript and jQuery

**Thoughts:** Sitting a web programming exam, so had a bit of a theory day. Studied and practiced some PHP for loops. 

### Day 52: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting much better at design the more I do it. I know it doesn't look right but I just didn't know how to fix it. I still have some difficulty really making things look as aesthetically pleasing as I would like, but definitely making some improvements.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 51: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Mmmm still not certain on the design. Changed it again. Played around with layout and responsive design styles. Much better now!

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 50: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** Really cranked through this project. Felt a lot easier than the calculator project. 

### Day 49: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More PHP 

**Thoughts:** Worked on a simple PHP/AJAX project.

### Day 48: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: PHP 

**Thoughts:** Watched a few tutorials on PHP. Less scary than I thought. 

**Link to work:** [JS Pomodoro Clock](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/pomodoro)

### Day 47: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued javascript calculator project

**Thoughts:** It's my birthday, but I still managed to get a fair amount of coding in. I'm still uncertain as to whether having 40 billion functions is normal. This is basically done though - except for All Clear functions.

**Link to work:** [JS Calculator](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/calculator)

### Day 46: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript algorithms on codewars

**Thoughts:** I'm getting more comfortable with organising code for projects, but I'm realising I'm still not crash hot on all the common javascript methods. Still having to look them up regularly.

### Day 45: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio

**Thoughts:** Implemented alertify for contact form submission. Form validation works!! Form submission works!! Wahooo.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 44: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio

**Thoughts:** Making my contact form work. Researched jQuery & PHP approaches but for now I think I'm going to go with formspree.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 43: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio

**Thoughts:** More tedious responsive design. Readjusting layout. Don't like my profile pic. Etc. 

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 42: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished tetris project

**Thoughts:** That took hours and hours and hours and hours but here we are! Beginning to have the grand realisation that no matter how overwhelming or difficult a project might seem, I'll probably find my way to hack through it. 

### Day 41: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued tetris project

**Thoughts:** Okay - things are starting to click. Now that I have some functions working, the display is beginning to work and I have a bit more reassurance that I'm on the right track.

### Day 40: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued tetris project

**Thoughts:** There are 40 bajillion lines of code. How to even start understanding this project? Found the simplest functions I could find and worked through how to understand them using the console. 

### Day 39: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued javascript calculator project

**Thoughts:** Javascript float calculations - why are they are so inaccurate?? Why are there so many goddamn decimal places?! Got some good suggestions about how to fix this, like with money.js or converting everything to whole numbers then dividing by 100. Still not quite what I need for the calculator, though.

**Link to work:** [JS Calculator](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/calculator)

### Day 38: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started javascript calculator project

**Thoughts:** This is something I feel a little more comfortable with. Mostly styling and layout. CSS skills are starting to feel a little more comfortable, this calculator actually looks pretty good and I barely wrote any code. Sass & bootstrap are quite helpful.

**Link to work:** [JS Calculator](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/calculator)

### Day 37: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic React tutorial. Started javascript tetris project

**Thoughts:** Cool - so that's what a javascript framework does.. No I still have no idea what's happening. Tetris? Hectic overwhelmed. 

### Day 36: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More advanced algorithms on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like a sloth working through these problems. 

### Day 35: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More advanced algorithms on freeCodeCamp. 'Weird javascript' section on udemy course.

**Thoughts:** These algorithms are taking HOURS. Way longer than the intermediate. I am doing SO much research into design patterns and methods. I guess this is probably what real developers do.

### Day 34: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started advanced algorithms on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Holy crap. Reading the descriptions hurts my brain. 

### Day 33: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on github pages portfolio site

**Thoughts:** It's hard not to get pedantic and spend hours on a small design issue.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 32: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on github pages portfolio site

**Thoughts:** Still working on having nice white space. It's hard not to get pedantic and spend hours on a small design issue.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 31: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on github pages portfolio site

**Thoughts:** Made it responsive. CSS is tedious.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/)

### Day 30: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Twitch.tv project with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've finished 6 front-end projects in 30 days. Considering I had basically zero knowledge of javascript before this, I feel freaking fantastic. 

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv Project](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/twitch_stream/)

### Day 29: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued Twitch.tv project with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Added filter buttons to view all/live only streams. Building individual functions doesn't feel so overwhelming anymore; designing the overall structure of a project from scratch still does.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv Project](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/twitch_stream/)

### Day 28: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued Twitch.tv project with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Added functionality to retrieve streaming status & link to channel. Small wins feel good.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv Project](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/twitch_stream/)

### Day 27: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch.tv project with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Mostly worked on design & styling today. Coding the functionality still feels overwheleming at this point.

**Link to work:** [Twitch.tv Project](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/frontend_projects/twitch_stream/)

### Day 26: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished all intermediate algorithms!

**Thoughts:** That was very challenging, but I feel incredibly accomplished considering how overwhelmed I was by the challenges a few days ago.

### Day 25: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ruby and javascript algorithms on Code Wars.

**Thoughts:** A very busy day for me. Glad to have still managed to get some coding in.

### Day 24: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More intermediate javascript algorithms on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm almost there. Using regexp has been a new and challenging experience. Some of the logic required for these algorithms feels very new to me. A lot of time spent researching methods.

### Day 23: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 3 intermediate javascript algorithms on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I'm finding these super challenging. They are taking a really long time to complete.

### Day 21: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More intermediate algorithms on freeCodeCamp. Learned about Sass. Implemented Sass in existing projects.

**Thoughts:** I really love Sass. I want to learn more about it, but I can see how powerful it is already from learning about variables, functions and extensions. Hearing about all these technologies I didn't know about used to freak me out, but after learning more and more, I'm realising they are all just ways to make life easier, and I'm feeling less overwhelmed.

### Day 20: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate algorithms on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Got through 8 algorithms. I'm feeling more confident with JavaScript and being able to quickly find & implement methods I need. Still took quite a few hours to get through these problems.

### Day 19: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts:** This took me hours to try and get around the js error message requesting a header for the mediawiki API. I tried creating an ajax post request and adding headers to that, and adding a callback call to the http request. Nothing was working, until I stumbled up on adding origin=* to the request, which I still don't entirely understand why it worked. Regardless, with the working link with a search query request from the API I managed to fairly easily figure out the functionality from then on. Spent a lot of time making the site responsive on smaller devices using flexbox. 

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/front_end_projects/wikipedia_viewer)

### Day 18: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Wikipedia Viewer project. 

**Thoughts:** Found out about github pages and created a basic site so my projects are easily viewable online. Took a while but found a way to compose a request to retrieve the information I needed from the media wiki API. Things are beginning to feel more complicated as I get through these projects and the curriculum, but I'm gaining confidence in my ability to work things out. I feel like I'm past the hard part of learning how to code, which is believing that I can.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://carlyminjoy.github.io/front_end_projects/wikipedia_viewer)

### Day 17: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Wikipedia Viewer project. Learned basic Sass. Worked through some js exercises on udemy. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to enjoy the workflow of committing changes and pushing to git regularly. Found Sass really interesting and exciting and decided to implement it in this project. Played around with creating color palettes and got a pretty good layout happening; will start working on the functionality tomorrow. Also, I'm up to day 6 of the JavaScript Advanced Beginner Challenge and feeling like I'm understanding different javascript frameworks a lot better. All the technologies that used to intimidate me are starting to feel a little less overwhelming.

### Day 16: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished weather app. Intermediate javascript algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Changed url to secure server & it seemed to fix the github viewer issues so my app can be rendered online through githubviewer. Finished one intermediate javascript algorithm working with Array.prototype.indexOf() method.

**Link to work:** [Weather App](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects/tree/master/weather_app)

### Day 15: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Added temperature functionality and toggle button for fahrenheit and celsius. Spent a lot of time on these functions and making code as clean as possible. Also added functionality to change background image to represent current weather conditions. Super happy with the design of my js code; I think it's really clean and easy to follow. I'm proud of this project. Feeling more confident with jQuery & retrieving data from APIs.

**Link to work:** [Weather App](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects/tree/master/weather_app)

### Day 14: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Worked on style and layout mainly today. Experimenting with Bootstrap alignment properties and responsivity.

**Link to work:** [Weather App](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects/tree/master/weather_app)

### Day 13: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on weather app

**Thoughts:** Still trying to figure out how to best retrieve data from the API. Still not totally confident with js and trying to get my head around correct methods and syntax. A lot of trial and error to achieve not much, but at least I'm beginning to get the hang of the language. Successfully retrieved the json at least - just need to find a way to design the js code cleanly.

**Link to work:** [Weather App](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects/tree/master/weather_app)

### Day 12: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started weather app

**Thoughts:** Wrote some js for retrieving coordinates. Had some trouble with CodePen constantly refreshing.. Had to migrate project to local development. 

**Link to work:** [Weather App](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects/tree/master/weather_app)

### Day 11: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** Added functionality to tweet quotes. Had some trouble with url string interpolation. Pretty happy with the result. 

**Link to work:** [Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/minjoyful/full/oeWWKo/)

### Day 10: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts:** Took ages and a lot of brain power and research to figure out the JSON API request via jQuery. First of all, realised I'm a total idiot and none of my tests were working because I forgot to add jQuery to CodePen. From there, I could start testing code and through trial and error and looking at a bunch of jQuery code, I think I created a pretty clean and concise way of achieving what I wanted. 

**Link to work:** [Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/minjoyful/full/oeWWKo/)

### Day 9: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Random Quote Generator Project on FCC

**Thoughts:** Thought I'd try to learn some flexbox for the basic layout of this one. Was pretty easy to refresh, though I'm still a bit dodgy on a lot of the properties. Trying to figure out how the hell to create an API request for JSON was impossible, spent hours with very little results. Where is the documentation to help for absolute beginners?

**Link to work:** [Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/minjoyful/full/oeWWKo/)

### Day 8: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started intermediate js algorithms

**Thoughts:** Completed one fairly easily, but got super stuck on the second one. Not totally familiar with js method calls yet but I think the logic is something I can figure out with a little more time. Just had to do some quick work today during a break at work.

### Day 7: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished JSON APIs section on FCC

**Thoughts:** Cool - doesn't look as difficult as I thought it was going to be. I never even knew what JSON or APIs meant until today. The more I learn, the less overwhelming things seem to be. 

### Day 6: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic Algorithmic Scripting challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Some pretty challenging concepts here - RegExp is still pretty over my head, no matter what language I'm working on. Proud that I got through this section but really would like to understand what just happened and understand the language a little better. I think I need to concurrently work on some more in-depth online courses, like udemy.

### Day 5: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic Algorithmic Scripting challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** The first few felt like a piece of cake until I started having to think more creatively when JavaScript didn't have the Ruby functions I'm used to. About the third or fourth challenge in, I felt myself slowing down and having to research documentation pretty thoroughly, which is great because it means I'm learning new things!

### Day 4: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished OOP JavaScript on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Things are starting to feel a little more challenging with JavaScript. The language is a little difficult to get my head around considering I'm so used to Ruby.

### Day 3: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Basic Javascript section on FCC. Finished a basic HTML/CSS site for a uni assignment. 

**Thoughts:** Things started to click really easily when learning JavaScript because it's somewhat similar to Java. When things start to click, I feel more motivated and inspired to keep going. HTML & CSS are starting to click too the more I do it. Hopefully I can keep this up.

**Link to work:** [Basic HTML/CSS site](https://github.com/carlyminjoy/frontend_projects)

### Day 2: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the 2nd FCC front-end project: Build a Portfolio Site.

**Thoughts:** Took probably around 6 hours to complete. I'm still finding things confusing, like the best way to construct a navigation with Bootstrap, when to use Bootstrap classes or custom classes, when to use padding or margins, when to use containers and whether to embed, etc. Trying to let go of the perfectionist attitude with my new motto "better done than good". Last time I tried to go through this curriculum I failed because I tried to make things perfect.. Won't be making that mistake again! 

**Link to work:** [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/minjoyful/pen/EvKaZw)

### Day 1: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the FCC curriculum. Completed HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & jQuery sections, along with project 1: Build a Tribute Page. 

**Thoughts:** The project was quite challenging and I was constantly looking up the Bootstrap documentation, but it felt good to work out for myself.

**Link to work:** [Tribute page](https://codepen.io/minjoyful/pen/dzGwrL)
